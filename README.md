# Values Finder

A command-line tool, implemented in Go, designed to help users discover their personal values through a series of simple choice comparisons. The system uses an LLM to generate pairs of options that contrast or drill deeper into the userâ€™s preferences based on their previous choices. After a fixed number of rounds, the LLM synthesizes a ranked list of 5 values with descriptions.
