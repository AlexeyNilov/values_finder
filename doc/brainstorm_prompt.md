Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea: I want to solve problem of finding personal values. I find out it is not a simple task for many people. My solution is based on asking a person to make simple choices between given options. The options are generated by LLM based on the previous choices. Repeating this process several times I hope to figure out concrete values. I want to develop this solution in Golang and initially keep provide only simple text interface.

Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.
